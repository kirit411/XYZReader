# XYZ Reader
Android Developer Nanodegree Program

## Overview
The task was to redesign an XYZ Reader app taking into account users feedback along with following
the Material Design guidelines and translating a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.
The starter code was taken from [here](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code).

## How to work with the project
Just clone this repository or download as an archive and import in Android Studio.

## Project Requirements

### Required Behavior
- [x] App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (`FloatingActionButton`, `AppBarLayout`, `SnackBar`, etc)
- [x] App uses `CoordinatorLayout` for the main Activity
- [x] App theme extends from `AppCompat`
- [x] App uses an `AppBar` and associated `Toolbar`s
- [x] App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s)
- [x] App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the [Material Design specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
- [x] App has a consistent color theme defined in `styles.xml`. Color theme does not impact usability of the app
- [x] App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements
- [x] App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed
- [x] App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting
- [x] App conforms to common standards found in the [Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines](http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html)
- [x] App utilizes stable release versions of all libraries, Gradle, and Android Studio

## What have I learnt?
* Applying Material Design guidelines to a mobile application
